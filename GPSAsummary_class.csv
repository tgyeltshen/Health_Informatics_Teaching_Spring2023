0,"ISMP Canada has received reports of incidents involving the medications glucagon, as well as incidents involving the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), in which only the product-specific diluent was administered. This can result in delay of treatment and patient injury. The Bulletin highlights numerous examples of this type of medication incident as a method for increasing the awareness of this patient safety risk."
1,"This Safety Notice addresses serious and fatal medication patient safety incidents involving hydromorphone. The majority of incidents involved administration errors including: - Confusion between the names and preparations of hydromorphone and morphine (wrong drug, wrong dose). - Poor understanding that hydromorphone is five times more potent than morphine (wrong drug). - Existence of both oral and injectable hydromorphone solutions that may increase the risk of product selection error during the administration process (wrong dose, wrong formulation). - Complex calculations due to the need for fractional dosing when using high potency ampoules and the inclusion of decimal points in the medication order (wrong dose)."
0,"This Patient Safety Advisory presents an analysis of medication errors and adverse drug events (both considered patient safety incidents) that involve hydromorphone, a high alert drug, which can result in patient harm and death. These incidents can occur during the prescribing, dispensing or administering phases of medication use. A key contributing factor is the gap in understanding hydromorphone's efficacy and potency. The majority of the patient safety incidents are ""wrong drug"" errors resulting from mix-ups with morphine. Wrong dose and overdose errors, as well as monitoring error and documented allergy errors are described as well with many patient cases to illustrate the points. Risk reduction strategies are provided within the following categories: constraints, standardization, differentiation, redundancies, patient monitoring, education and information, and monitoring of adverse drug events."
0,"This Safety Notice describes a patient safety incident where a topical antiseptic was administered through an epidural route, resulting in neurological complications (wrong route). A position statement of safety medication practices when using drugs for epidural anesthesia or analgesia, developed by the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists is provided ."
0,"This article addresses how medication packaging and labelling can contribute to medication patient safety incidents.

Actions to reduce risk, based on the UK National Health Service (NHS) guide for labelling and packaging of injectable medications, are provided."
0,"The Bulletin describes a medication incident in which a patient died as a result of receiving insulin that had not be prescribed. The patient underwent surgery for a gastrointestinal problem and postoperative recovery was proceeding normally. Early on the morning of the third postoperative day, the patient was found unresponsive with a low glucometer reading and low oxygen saturation. Interventions were provided but the patient died the next morning. The autopsy pathology report listed the underlying cause of death as hypoglycemia related to exogenous insulin administration. The hospital undertook an investigation and determined the most likely explanation appeared to be substitution of insulin for a scheduled subcutaneous dose of heparin on the evening before the patient was found unresponsive. The root cause analysis findings, including contributing factors and recommended actions, are also provided."
0,"This Risk Alert describes a fatal patient safety incident where a lymphoma patient with a positive hepatitis B status received chemotherapy without prophylactic anti-viral therapy. A lymphoma patient was scheduled for chemotherapy. As part of the standard pre-chemotherapy workup, the patientÅfs hepatitis B (HBV) status"
0,"The Bulletin describes an incident in which a patient's height and weight were transposed in an electronic chemotherapy prescribing system. As a result, the patient received about 650mg more panitumumab than intended for their first dose. The error was detected and the remaining two doses were administered according to the treatment plan. The patient was admitted to hospital with symptoms of a pulmonary embolism a week after the third dose and died a few days later. Panitumumab is known to cause pulmonary emboli, but it is not known if the initial dose of medication influenced the outcome. The error represents a critical failure in the safety structure for managing orders for oncology medications. Information about the incident is shared as an alert about the potential vulnerabilities of electronic prescribing systems. Possible contributing factors, and recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of electronic systems, are described."
0,"A consumer prevented serious harm to herself and her spouse by questioning unusual side effects to her medications. She had requested two refill prescriptions from a pharmacy. The first refill was for warfarin and the second refill was for trazodone. A few days after picking up the prescriptions, the consumer was feeling unusually tired and drowsy and her spouse was not sleeping as well as usual. The consumer called the pharmacy to ask if the prescriptions had been filled with different brands of warfarin and trazodone, or if the wrong medications had been dispensed. The pharmacy investigated and determined that the labels on the two containers had been switched. Recommendations to consumers are also described."
1,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses medication patient safety incidents where breakdowns in the storage of medications have contributed to drug product mix-ups. The errors resulting most frequently have been wrong drug, wrong dose / overdose, wrong dosage form and wrong strength / concentration. Mix-ups of drugs can occur anywhere in the hospital but have been particularly noted in the following areas: ward stock of patient care units, night cupboard, pharmacy and refrigerators both in pharmacy and patient care areas. Contributing factors as per the storage area are as follows: - ward stock: storage of multiple concentrations of the same drug in close proximity and storage of multiple-dose containers used as floor stock rather than pharmacy providing patient-specific doses, - night cupboard: accessibility and variety of medications available, as well as a potential lack of an independent double check of the original order to the obtained medication, - pharmacy: a large volume of drug products is stored in one area of the facility, purchases from a single manufacturer that uses a consistent brand appearance, layout, and label design for their products, increasing the risk of look-alike products, - refrigerator: limited space or lack of built-in discrete pockets or bins. Depending on the location of the refrigerator, it may be used to store manufacturer-packaged products for floor stock use, as well as patient-specific or patient-labelled products, increasing the risk that a healthcare practitioner may select the wrong drug. "
0,"This Risk Alert addresses several medication patient safety incidents where patients with a known drug allergy are prescribed and/or administered a drug that has been identified as a drug the patient is allergic to. The preponderance of antibiotics, such as penicillin, in these medication patient incidents is identified."
0,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses medication patient safety incidents involving the use of insulin; most common drug errors resulting are drug omission, wrong drug and wrong dose/overdose, in order of greatest frequency. A number of patient safety incidents are provided to illustrate the types of errors. Sevesimiral contributing factors are presented and include the following: - similarities in the brand and generic drug names - similarity in drug labelling and packaging - wrong drug written by prescriber - wrong drug selected during order entry - wrong drug selected from ward stock or automated dispensing cabinet - confusion between regular insulin and rapid acting insulin - prescribing orders were not clear which insulin was requested - use of the incorrect blood glucose value - confusion in the labelling of insulin by pharmacy - confusion in interpreting or writing sliding scale or insulin coverage orders - use of dangerous abbreviations such as ""U"" for ""units - use of an insulin syringe intended for 100 units/mL of insulin to draw up doses of insulin 500 units/mL"
0,"This Patient Safety Alert warns of a potential packaging problem with Viaspan that could lead to inadvertent intravenous administration. Viaspan is a solution that is used to flush and provide cold storage of organs for transplantation and if the medication is inadvertently given by intravenous access, cardiac arrest is likely. Concerns with the packaging include font size and position on the label, the set port size of the container, and the inter-organization mechanisms through which the solution is distributed."
1,"This Safety Bulletin presents an aggregate, qualitative analysis of 456 patient safety incidents involving cancer chemotherapy agents providing major themes and subthemes as well as key contributing factors. The latter can be used to provide insights into areas for system improvements and implementation of safeguards in dealing with cancer chemotherapy.

Considerations include potential side effects, drug interactions, food interactions, allergies, renal and liver function, as well as ongoing monitoring. Three case studies are used to illustrate the importance of managing medications and the applicable side effects. Recommendations for medication management are provided."
0,"This Safety Notice discusses medication patient safety incidents involving midazolam (a high alert drug) where administering the wrong dose has resulted in over-sedation. Contributing factors to these incidents include the following: - Mistaken strength: Midazolam is produced by several manufacturers in two strengths of 1mg/mL and 5mg/mL in a variety of ampoule sizes for both intramuscular and intravenous injection. It is also administered by intranasal, oral, buccal, rectal and subcutaneous routes. - Storage conditions in clinical areas: As Midazolam is stored as an S4D (ward stock item) in small, often overstocked narcotic safes or emergency trolleys, there is increased potential for selection error to occur. - Unclear communication related to use of Midazolam in emergency situations."
1,"This Patient Safety Advisory concerns patient safety incidents that occur in labour and delivery and involve high-alert drugs. The most frequent types of error that occur are, in order of greatest frequency, dose omission, wrong drug, wrong dose, overdose, and wrong rate. Contributing factors include unfamiliarity with safe dosage ranges and signs of toxicity, inadequate patient monitoring, pump programming errors, and confusion between magnesium sulfate, oxytocin, and intravenous (IV) fluids used for hydration. Detailed strategies for risk reduction are provided according to the following themes: standardizing the dosing and administration protocols as well as standardizing the concentrations and dosing units of drug infusions and adopting a policy that all infusions be administered with an infusion pump."
1,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses serious and fatal patient safety incidents involving the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent, a high alert drug. The most frequent errors are wrong dose, wrong dose / overdose and unauthorized drug / wrong drug. Contributing factors include unsafe storage, similar product packaging and labelling, look-alike drug names, and unlabelled syringes."
0,"This Safety Bulletin reviews multiple patient safety incidents, gathered through an international aggregate analysis, that involved fentanyl transdermal patches. A further Canadian sub-analysis of over 3000 patient safety incidents was conducted; three primary themes and common contributing factors of that sub-analysis are described. Actions to reduce risk from both the international and Canadian analyses are provided."
1,This Safety Bulletin reviews multiple patient safety incidents where Spiriva? (tiotropium bromide) has been taken orally instead of by inhalation. It also describes two patient safety incidents of hydromorphone controlled release capsules given by inhalation instead of Spiriva? due to the similar color and shape of the two drug capsules.
0,"This Patient Safety Topic reviews a significant patient safety incident which resulted from administration of IV phenytoin (Dilantin?) and identifies risk factors that include dosing, patient characteristics, and flushing, diluting solutions. Recommendations to mitigate likelihood of this incident."
0,This Safety Alert concerns patient safety incidents where powder for inhalation was dissolved and administered via mechanical ventilation (wrong route) resulting in death.
0,"The Bulletin describes two incidents where paediatric patients developed hyponatremia associated with the intravenous administration of hypotonic solutions; one in a postsurgical setting and the other in a medical setting. Both incidents resulted in death. Acute hyponatremia is defined as a decline in serum sodium within a 48-hour period to less than 130 mmol/L. This abrupt change can lead to cerebral edema as a result of electrolyte-free water moving into the brain cells. Acute hyponatremia can be fatal for both children and adults; however, children are more vulnerable to the effects of fluid and electrolyte imbalance. The early signs of acute hyponatremia and rising intracranial pressure are often nonspecific and include nausea, vomiting, headache, and decreasing level of consciousness. Information from the 2 voluntary incident reports, including recommendations and considerations, is shared to enhance healthcare practitionersÅf understanding of the potential for fatal hyponatremia in children. Many Canadian pediatric centres have recognized hospital-acquired hyponatremia as an important issue that merits attention and have revised, or are in the process of revising,"
0,"This article discusses the importance of clinical monitoring in prescribing, dispensing, and administration of medication. The necessity of considering renal function, age and other clinical parameters in determining drug dosage is reviewed. Technology support of interfaced computerized physician order entry systems, pharmacy computer systems and laboratory systems faciliate communication of critical information to relevant health care providers."
0,This Risk Alert describes a medication patient safety incident where a high loading dose of a drug was incorrectly administered as an IV bolus rather than an IV infusion resulting in toxic effects.
0,"This Patient Safety Advisory addresses the patient safety incidents that can occur when necessary monitoring of laboratory values is not ordered or performed or when abnormal levels occur and action is not taken by healthcare practitioners. The focus is on the use of levofloxacin, the most common medication involved in a review of patient safety incidents of this nature. Contributing factors to the incidents include the following: - Prescribers may not be aware of the need to assess renal function and adjust doses as necessary. - Clinical laboratory values may not be readily available to practitioners at the time of prescribing, dispensing, and administering. Even in facilities with electronic systems, laboratory computer systems may not interface with computerized prescriber order-entry (CPOE) and pharmacy computer systems. If the systems do interface, CPOE and pharmacy computer systems may not generate alerts to warn practitioners about high doses with respect to serum creatinine levels. - CPOE systems may not have effective computer based clinical decision support to help guide appropriate dose selection for patients with renal insufficiency or advanced age.4,6 - The clinical status of the patient may require administration of a first dose of an antibiotic before an accurate assessment of renal function is available."
1,"This Patient Safety Advisory provides an update to the September 2006 Advisory on errors that occur with epinephrine, a high alert drug. Subsequent reports have been analyzed and discussed; the top four types of errors, in order of frequency of occurrence, were wrong route, wrong drug, wrong dose / overdose. Strategies for improvement, in addition to those included in the September 2006 Advisory, are provided."
0,"This Safety Bulletin presents the results of phase 1 of a collaborative endeavour by the Canadian Association of Paediatric Health Centres, Institute for Safe Medication Practices Canada and the Canadian Patient Safety Institute to enhance the safety of paediatric medication use. Review of over 4000 paediatric incident reports determined the top 5 drugs causing harm through medication error in paediatrics. A qualitative analysis of the top 5 drugs provides a summary of contributing factors for each of the drugs. Phase 2 of this project will focus on identification of system solutions for enhanced opioid safety and will identify practices and medication system safety strategies for inclusion in a resource toolkit for Canadian paediatric opioid safety."
0,"The Advisory refers to incidents that have occurred locally, nationally and internationally where oral liquid medications have been drawn up into a hypodermic syringe and administered intravenously (IV) in error. The presence of medications in a hypodermic syringe might suggest that the medication is intended for parenteral administration. In many of the incidents, there were other errors involved; however oral medications drawn up into a hypodermic syringe was identified as the root cause. Two medication errors: involving the same drug with different patient consequences Oral Phenytoin Liquid Case Studies A patient was prescribed oral phenytoin liquid mixture for control of epileptic seizures. The mixture was drawn up in a hypodermic syringe, checked against the medication chart and taken to the patient bedside. The nurse administering the medications became distracted and inadvertently administered the medication into the patients central line instead of their nasogastric tube. Medical assistance was sought immediately and the patient suffered no clinical harm. In another incident, a woman with a complex medical history including epilepsy was hospitalised for gastrointestinal complications. A jejunostomy was performed to facilitate feeding and administration of oral medications, including oral liquid phenytoin. She was later started on total parenteral nutrition after complications and her oral medications orders were converted to IV. About two weeks later, a nurse who had previously administered oral medications to the patient prepared two IV medications and had these checked. The nurse then obtained the oral phenytoin liquid, measured 5mL into a cup and then drew it into a syringe. She administered the medications to the patient including the oral phenytoin liquid via central venous catheter (CVC). The patient complained of pain at the injection site and commenced dry retching before losing consciousness. Staff commenced resuscitation but the woman could not be revived."
0,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses medication patient safety incidents that occur during radiologic procedures and involve both radiologic and non-radiologic type drugs. The most common errors resulting were wrong drug, administration of an unauthorized drug, wrong dose and wrong rate. Medication errors in radiology are seven times more likely to harm patients, compared to errors in other settings. Contributing factors to errors occurring in radiologic services include the following: - the complexity of radiologic procedures, - the use of high-alert medications such as intravenous (IV) contrast agents, sedatives, vasopressors, and blood coagulation modifiers, - the risk of communication failures during handoffs, - the very brief amount of time a patient spends undergoing a radiologic procedure, - patient transfer to and from a radiologic care setting presents the opportunity for miscommunication and lack of access to patient information sets the stage for errors to occur. - the care provided to the patient is very much focused on a particular procedure; drugs that were administered pre-examination, or those to be continued post examination, may not be given sufficient attention. - imaging drugs are supposed to be administered by a radiologic staff member under the supervision of a radiologist or other physician. In reality, these medications are sometimes administered without a radiologist ever actually seeing the patient or the patient's medical record. - there is sometimes no written prescription and no written documentation on a patientÅfs medication administration record when these drugs are administered. Because of this, there is very little opportunity for a pharmacistÅfs involvement in reviewing the orders and screening the patient for allergies, drug-drug interactions, or drug-disease state warnings before the medication is administered. Recommendations for risk reduction are provided."
0,This Safety Information discusses patient safety incidents of possible suicidal and aggressive behaviour resulting from use of a smoking cessation drug.
0,This Safety Notice discusses patient safety incidents where patients experienced harm due to receiving two drugs that posed a serious drug interaction. One case is described where the patient was on existing azathioprine treatment when admitted to hospital and allopurinol was added by a consulting medical team. Opportunities to identify the interaction were missed by the consulting and treating medical teams and pharmacists. Contributing factors to the incident included the following: - The consulting medical team did not assess the patientÅfs existing therapy when recommending treatment with allopurinol. - The patientÅfs medicines were not thoroughly reviewed during their admission. - The medical teams were unaware of the interaction and associated risks. - The supervising pharmacist was not notified of the drug interaction alert automatically generated by the pharmacy dispensing software.
0,"This Risk Alert describes a medication patient safety incident, reported by ISMP, of a methotrexate overdose. A transcription error resulted in a daily dosage regimen instead of the weekly regimen intended. A 72-year-old female patient with a history of rheumatoid arthritis required oral methotrexate 10mg BID weekly on Mondays in the hospital. Although the dosage was correctly listed on her medication reconciliation form, a transcription error, Ågmethotrexate 10mg BIDÅh, was made on the discharge medication list. Hence, the patient was wrongly taking oral methotrexate daily instead of weekly. The error was discovered by a visiting nurse after the patient complained of mucositis and diarrhea. The patient was told to stop the methotrexate and attend the emergency department Lab results supported the commencement of filgrastim and darbepoetin to correct her white and red blood cell counts respectively."
0,This Risk Alert discusses multiple medication patient safety incidents in paediatrics relating to wrong infusion rates.
0,"The Bulletin contains a review of one Canadian and thirty-three international medication incidents regarding Prograf and Advagraf mix-ups. There is potential for significant patient harm if these drugs are mistakenly interchanged, including acute rejection of transplanted organs and toxic effects due to overexposure. A summary of the contributing factors and recommended actions to reduce the risk of recurrence are provided."
0,"This Clinical Alert communicates the risks of using fentanyl transdermal patches. Description of a patient safety incident is used to illustrate problems that may occur with prescribing and monitoring of fentanyl transdermal. Contributing factors of the incident are provided and several recommended actions to reduce risk are made The case of a 85 year old female in a long-term care facility treated for pain is described. She was prescribed acetaminophen 1 000 mg every six hours for the moderate to severe back pain she was experiencing. Several weeks later the pain had not abated despite nearly around-the-clock use of acetaminophen. The physician discontinued the acetaminophen and ordered Percocet? (oxycodone/acetaminophen 5mg/325mg), one tablet by mouth every six hours as needed for pain. The patient requested all four doses daily. Three days after beginning Percocet? therapy, pain continued and Duragesic? (fentanyl) 75 mcg transdermal patch every 72 hours was ordered. The following day the patient was very lethargic; her respiratory rate was eight breaths per minute. The physician ordered the fentanyl patch to be removed. The patient was sent to the hospital; on route EMS administered two doses of Narcan? (naloxone) with short-term improvement. The patient arrived at the Emergency Room and was found to be unresponsive with a respiratory rate of six breaths per minute. The patient was intubated and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where she remained on a Narcan? drip for two days. She subsequently developed aspiration pneumonia. After eight days in the hospital, she was stable enough to return to the nursing home."
0,"A medication had a defaulted schedule of QID (four times a day), with administration times of 9am, 1pm, 5pm and 9pm (0900, 1300, 1700 and 2100). When the CPRS user typed BID (twice a day) to change the schedule and then pressed the <Enter> key, the four QID administration times remained stored with the order, instead of only the two BID administration times of 9am and 5pm (0900 and 1700). (See Attachment 1). This problem has existed in prior versions of CPRS and was reported at a VAMC. This problem may lead to underdosing or overdosing of medications. We are not aware of any patient harm at this time. The Alert contains general information regarding the issue and actions for implementation by applicable VA facilities."
0,"Patients with marked insulin resistance can be prescribed a concentrated form of human insulin in a concentration of 500 units/mL. Nationally, confusion between U-100 and U-500 insulin concentration during prescribing, dispensing and administration has caused significant patient harm. The VA National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) has reviewed the Patient Safety Information System database and found multiple patient incidents related to the U-500 insulin. The Alert lists actions to be implemented in applicable VA facilities."
0,"A patient was admitted to a surgical unit following an intracranial hemorrhage. The patient was later transferred to medicine following complications from a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and was treated with a heparin infusion. The patient's clotting time was sub therapeutic and the physician was contacted. The physician ordered 2,000 units of heparin stat, but the nurse incorrectly administered 20,000 units of heparin. The nurse immediately recognized her error and notified the physician. On assessment, the patient had a decreased level of consciousness and the medical emergency team was called. The patient was subsequently transferred to ICU and intubated. Treatment was withdrawn four days later due to a poor neurological outcome and the patient died. This alert describes an action to reduce risk."
0,"Critical incidents have occurred when unfractionated heparin (UFH) has been inappropriately prescribed and administered. Errors include inappropriate dose prescribed, incorrect dose administered, and delayed or inappropriate dose adjustments in response to clotting time results. Contributing factors include: UFH is prescribed for multiple indications which increases the risk of dosage errors: UFH has a narrow therapeutic range and can produce unpredictable adverse reactions at therapeutic doses; increasing monitoring is also required when using heparin in combination with interacting drugs or when the patient has certain co-existing conditions; and there are many presentations of UFH available that may look alike and therefore lead to selection error. This alert describes actions to reduce risk."
1,"This Safety Bulletin reviews errors resulting in patient safety incidents where epinephrine for topical use was inadvertently injected. A fatal case report is presented with description of contributing factors. Actions to reduce the risk on injecting epinephrine for topical use are provided. During a day surgery ENT procedure, the surgeon requested lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000 and was handed a pre-drawn syringe. The surgeon injected the medication into the surgical site. Immediately afterward, the patient experienced a cardiac arrhythmia leading to cardiac arrest. Despite full resuscitation measures, the patient died. Information gathered after the incident indicated that the syringe contained epinephrine 1 mg/mL (1:1000) intended for topical use, rather than the local anesthetic for injection that was requested."
0,"This Risk Alert discusses multiple patient safety incidents identified and reviewed by the NPSA of midazolam overdose during intravenous sedation. Actions to reduce risk are provided. The alert also reviews a patient safety incident of a midazolam overdose which occurred in Hong Kong. Availability of high strength midazolam in patient treatment areas and description of the dose in terms of ""mL"" instead of ""mg"" to communicate dose are identified as contributing factors."
0,"Serious patient safety incidents can occur when a patient is given medication via the wrong route. Several patient safety incidents have occurred where medication intended for administration by the oral or enteral route was administered by intravenous injection, resulting in the patient's death. Key contributing factors related to wrong route errors with oral medication include: 1. medications intended for oral use have been prepared in standard, parenteral syringes and administered intravenously in error. Examples include liquid medications and oral tablets that have been crushed and missed with fluid. 2. medications were prepared in a parenteral syringe for oral administration by one nurse and then administered by a different nurse, via the intravenous route. 3. medications involved were available in a range of different formulations for administration by different routes (e.g. oral liquid and intravenous preparations of the same product). 4. The prescribed drug form (e.g. oral suspension) was not available on the ward. 5. Oral dispensers (in the form of colour-coded syringes) which are specifically designed to be incompatible with intravenous cannulae and tubing and other venous access devices were not commonly used or freely available in patient care areas. 6. Patients had multiple lines in place, including intravenous lines and enteral lines (e.g. nasogastric and nasojejeunal lines). 7. Staff failed to understand the requirements for preparing an aseptic product for injection. 8. Lack of knowledge/understanding of the stringent preparation processes and standards mandated for all intravenous solutions. In this Safety Notice, actions to reduce risk have been included for further information."
0,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses the potential for medication patient safety incidents if the incorrect patient weight is measured, reported, documented, or communicated. The most frequent errors resulting are wrong dose / overdose and wrong dose / underdose. High alert medications are frequently involved and, thus, the outcome can be significant. Contributing factors include the following: - failures to obtain accurate patient weight measurements, - once a weight was obtained, misuse of that value. Examples included: - problems when patients arrive at a hospital and are not weighed, leading to estimates of patient weights, - assumptions that documented weights are current and/or accurate, and - documentation breakdowns (e.g., the patient is weighed in pounds, but the weight is erroneously documented as kilograms). Several patient safety incidents are described and strategies to mitigate risk are provided."
0,This Risk Alert discusses a fatal patient safety incident where a patient was given a dose of vincristine intrathecally instead of intravenously.
0,"This Safety Notice discusses patient safety incidents where patient experience avoidable side effects of amiodarone (a high alert drug) administration. The main contributing factors to the development of side effects such as thrombophlebitis were administration of amiodarone peripherally at a concentration which was too high, repeated or continuously administered."
0,"This Risk Alert discusses a medication patient safety incident where the wrong concentration of adrenalin was used. The focus of the alert addresses confusion of drug dosage related to interchanging use of the terms ""mL"", ""mg"" and ""%"" to communicate dose."
0,"It is well-known to healthcare practitioners that use of nitroglycerin therapy is contraindicated in patients taking sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra). Many healthcare practitioners may be unaware that sildenafil is also marketed under the brand name Revatio, for treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease. The Bulletin describes a medication incident where an emergency patient in her mid-50s on Revatio was administered nitroglycerin sublingual and intravenously until an internist noted the potential drug interaction and the nitroglycerin was discontinued. The patient experienced no adverse effects. A summary of the contributing factors and recommended actions to reduce the risk of recurrence are provided."
0,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses medication patient safety incidents that occur despite the use of bar-coding medication administration (BCMA) technology. The Advisory stresses that technology alone does not ensure a safe medication-use system, and the process changes that accompany any technology can introduce new sources of error. Contributing factors to errors in a bar-code environment include failures to use this technology appropriately, employing workarounds or overriding alerts, disruptions in the medication administration process, and dispensing errors that arise in the pharmacy where the wrong bar-code is applied to the wrong drug or wrong drug strength. Recommendations to reduce risk of these errors are provided."
0,"This Quality Use of Medicines Alerts discusses the risk of patient safety incidents with the use of fentanyl patches. This alert contains main messages regarding the risk, recommended actions to reduce risk and information to be provided to patients on fentanyl patches. Several patient safety incidents are described."
1,This Quality Use of Medicines Alert discusses patient safety incidents related to prescribing and administration of subcutaneous insulin. A wrong dose and/or wrong formulation of insulin has resulted. Several patient safety incidents are described. Contributing factors include the following: - Using the non-approved abbreviation ÅeUÅf for units. Doses prescribed using the abbreviation ÅeUÅf for units has led to staff misinterpreting the ÅeUÅf as a ÅezeroÅf and resulted in a ten-fold increase in the d
0,"This Risk Alert discusses a near miss medication patient incident where a 10 fold overdose of cyclophosphamide was averted. A 55-kg adult patient was diagnosed with WegenerÅfs granulomatosis while staying in ICU. A physician prescribed IV cyclophosphamide 2.2g daily for 3 days but the diagnosis was not stated in the order. A pharmacist reviewed the order and had doubt about mesna not prescribed with high dose cyclophosphamide. On obtaining the diagnosis, the unusual high cyclophosphamide dose for an autoimmune disorder such as WegenerÅfs granulomatosis was noted. The pharmacist contacted the physician. The physician realized that he had intended to order a dose of 220mg and changed the order."
0,"This Risk Alert discusses several medication patient safety incidents where patients with a known drug allergy are prescribed, dispensed and/or administered a drug that has been identified as a drug the patient is allergic to. The preponderance of penicillin and cephalosporin related medication patient incidents are presented."
0,"The Bulletin describes a near-miss medication incident where the incorrect dosage of cyclophosphamide was almost given intravenously to a patient in the Intensive Care Unit for a non-oncology indication (Wegener's granulomatosis) due to a misread, handwritten note. A summary of the contributing factors and recommended actions to reduce the risk of recurrence are provided."
0,"Whenever pediatric and adult patient populations are treated in the same location, there is a high risk of harm from an ""incorrect patient"" error, particularly when a high-alert medication is involved. The Bulletin highlights an incident ""in which an infant was inadvertently given a dose of hydromorphone intended for an adult patient"". The physician inadvertently picked up the infant's chart after examining a palliative care patient. An order for hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 4 mg to be given orally was written. The infant's nurse did approach the physician to ask if he had intended to order the hydromorphone 4 mg. The physician verbally confirmed the order as written; however, neither healthcare provider used any patient identifiers during the conversation. A comprehensive summary of the contributing factors and recommendations are included in the bulletin."
0,"This Sentinel Event Alert discusses medication patient safety incidents related to the administration of anticoagulants. Contributing factors to errors include the following: - Lack of standardization for the naming, labelling and packaging of anticoagulants creates confusion. For example, heparin flush syringes have been confused with LMW heparin syringes. In addition, other, lesser-known anticoagulant drug names exist (e.g., enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin) and are used less commonly, which can result in duplicate medication orders and erroneous dosing. - Keeping current with different dosing regimens for various patient populations, newer assay methods, the expanding lists of drug interactions, and the potential reversal strategies can be a challenge for providers?especially those who infrequently prescribe or administer anticoagulants. - The specific and individualized instructions and monitoring information (for example, dose adjustments, lab values, changing patient condition) that accompany the prescribing and administration of anticoagulants may fail to get documented or communicated during transfers and hand-offs. - Neonates and other pediatric patients are problematic to treat, specifically because the medications are formulated and packaged primarily for adults. Recommendations for general management of anticoagulant therapy and specific recommendations to reduce risk of error with all anticoagulants, heparin and warfarin are provided."
0,"A Clinical Alert regarding the risk of vascular injury, including ischemia and resulting amputation, associated with the intravenous administration of Promethazine (Phenergan). The description of two patient safety incidents are provided as case studies. A 40 year-old patient with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that received half of the ordered 12.5 mg of promethazine in 10cc normal saline before it was stopped due to burning at the IV site (forearm). His thumb and index finger were later amputated. The second incident involved a 90 year-old patient with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. She and an IV inserted in the back of her wrist and was given 12.5mg of promethazine IV. Within a few hours, she complained of pain in her hand. An amputation (unknown extent) was performed and wide spread tissue necrosis was noted at the time of surgery. The alert includes a variety of recommendations culled from various sources, including RCAs submitted, ISMP recommendations, the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority, and the Infusion Nurses Society."

0,This Risk Alert outlines global strategies for reducing the risk of intrathecal administration of chemotherapeutic medications.
0,"This alert has been summarized from the original NHS alert and describes a patient safety incident where the patient received an overdose of an oral chemotherapeutic drug. A patient with an aggressive brain tumour was prescribed a high dose of oral chemotherapy (temozolomide oral, 350mg, once daily) to be taken for 5 days followed by a 23 day rest period. This cycle was to be repeated 5 times. After obtaining the original prescription, the patient re-presented four times at pharmacy and was dispensed a repeat prescription over a 26 day period without staff recognizing the patient was not applying the 23 day rest period. The error was recognized when the patient contacted his neuro-oncology consultant for a new prescription after taking 25 doses over 31 days. Following recognition of the overdose, the patient was administered pegfi lgrastim a G-CSF (granlocyte-colony stimulating factor), to stimulate bone marrow production of white blood cells as he was at high risk of becoming neutropenic as a result of the overdose. The patient survived another 6 months and his subsequent death was not deemed related to this incident. Contributing factors were that the patient did not clearly understand the dosing regimen and because the repeat prescriptions were `dispensed within a 5 ? 8 day timeframe rather than a 28 day gap. Actions taken by the facility to reduce likelihood of recurrence of this type of incident are presented."

0,"This Patient Safety Bulletin reviews concerns with labelling of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and presents recommendations to prevent risk of error. The manufacture of the immunoglobulin results in batches of medication with different strengths. A minimum strength is assured for all batches but the actual strength of the medication is noted on a separate label from the general label on the front of the vial. A patient safety incident is described where a patient received an overdose (wrong dose) of hepatitis B immunoglobulin. A patient came in for her monthly dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, required following a liver transplant to decrease the risk of hepatitis. The on-call pharmacist, unaware of a recent change in the supplier of the medication and not present for the staff briefing on the change and its implications for patient safety, entered the drug into the Pharmacy computer system incorrectly using the concentration on the front of the box ( >312 IU/mL) (minimum assured concentration) versus the correct concentration of 570 IU/mL - written sideways on the side of the vial. In addition, the IV label printed the correct dose (20,000 units), however, the volume (mLs) on the label was incorrect. Upon investigation it was discovered that the new drug was also entered incorrectly in the drug database resulting in an incorrect volume. The medication was mixed by the IV technician and checked by another pharmacist all without noticing the correct vial concentration on the side of the vial. The final, and incorrect, infusion the patient received was 33,000 units versus the correct 20,000 units. Contributing factors of the incident included: - A labelling difference between the box the medication came in, and the vial containing the medication - Label on the side of the vial listing the actual strength of the medication - Staff briefings typically do not include resource or on-call pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Due to sometimes-long absences, email notices are often missed by on-call pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. - The change in the strength was displayed correctly and clearly in the computer system, but the incorrect volume was missed, which resulted in an inaccurate dose. - Because the initial basis for the calculating the dose was wrong, the pharmacistÅfs double check of the IV infusion by the pharmacy technician did not pick up the error. - Because the label on the box of the new immunoglobulin read the same as the previous immunoglobulin, the pharmacists missed the small print off to the side on the box and on the vial itself."

0,"This lesson describes a fatal patient safety incident where poor communication and lack of appropriate clinical management guidelines resulted in the patient's death due to a known, severe side effect of a drug. A routine blood test on a mental health patient treated with clozapine revealed low white blood cells. Neutropenia/agranulocytosis is a known potential side effect of clozapine. The haematologist recommended that: the patient be taken to the hospital emergency department for urgent medical review; to cease clozapine until further notice; the patientÅfs temperature should be closely monitored and Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF) should commence to increase white blood cell production. This information was emailed to the mental health team and communicated to mental health and emergency department triage staff. The patient was assessed by ED staff late that day. No follow up for antibiotics or GCSF was done. The patient was transferred to the acute psychiatric ward where, on the third day, he developed a temperature. IV antibiotics were commenced, the patient was transferred to an acute inpatient unit and monitoring continued. Ten days later the patient developed hypotension and tachycardia and was transferred to ICU with septic shock. Medications and treatment were given including GCSF and inotropes. The patient died the following week from sepsis and multi organ failure. Contributing factors incl"
0,"An elderly home care client was living alone and receiving Fentanyl patches. The Fentanyl dose was increased to 112 mg, which required one patch of 100 mg and one of 12 mg. The patient's Primary Nurse was off so a variety of casual, regular and agency replacement nurses were making the home visits. During one of the visits, the agency nurse applied only one 12 mg patch. The client presented to hospital shortly after with hallucinations, restless limb movements, numbness and tingling in one arm, and some confusion. The client was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of opioid withdrawal associated with delirium. There was no evidence of a narcotic sign off sheet in the Home Care Nursing File to keep count of narcotics. Replacement/Agency nurses are utilized for home visits after all Home Care resources have been exhausted. The assignment sheets are not prioritized for this replacement nurse and their orientation is one day with a 2-hour office orientation. The WRHA provides Home Care nurses with a full week orientation. The way in which the Home Care Visiting Nurse file is organized makes it difficult to find corroborating information at a glance."
0,"The patient presented to hospital with increased abdominal and leg swelling as well as shortness of breath. The patient had a significant history of heart disease, including congestive heart disease, and was awaiting assessment for possible aortic valve replacement. Incomplete medication reconciliation (Med Rec) resulted in the patient receiving two doses of the previously stopped medication Ramipril. Ramipril was listed on the patient's dispensing history in the Drug Programs Information Network (DPIN) however it had been discontinued prior to the patient's admission to the Emergency Department. The physicians believed the patient was actively receiving and tolerating the medication prior to presentation and wanted to maintain the regime. Two doses of Ramipril were given then the patient became hypotensive and developed chest pain. The patient was transferred to ICU and died 4 days later."
0,An infant with multiple medical problems was referred to the Emergency Department (ED) from a pediatrician's office. The infant was in significant respiratory distress and needed intubation as well as initiation of Dopamine/Epinephrine. Two medication errors occurred: the dose of Dopamine was given at twice the intended rate and the Epinephrine infusion rate was decreased rather than increased. There was no apparent harm to the infant however the possibility of subtle damage cannot be conclusively ruled out. The incident occurred less than two weeks after the pediatric emergency services were moved to a new area and staff were not yet familiar with the location of supplies and/or equipment. It was difficult to detect a non-standard concentration of the Dopamine since the labels on the two different concentrations (800 micrograms per ml and 1600 micrograms per ml) were almost identical. The non-standardized concentration of Dopamine (1600 micrograms per ml) for a pediatric area was used. Verbal orders to change the dosage of Epinephrine were unclear and interpreted incorrectly. Decision aids for drug dosing and infusion preparation did not provide the requisite information for staff. The medication errors were not documented on the patient's chart.
0,"A patient experienced apnea and recurrent respiratory depression that was treated and improved with Narcan administration. The patient was transferred to ICU for closer monitoring and returned to the unit the next day. The approach to pain control was not optimal and the respiratory symptoms were related to over medication. The patient's dehydration was not assessed prior to second Emergency physician assessment and it is unclear if all the patient's symptoms were truly secondary to pain, or whether there was another process involved such as dementia or delirium."

0,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses serious and fatal patient safety incidents that can occur with the use of sterile water for injection and sterile water for inhalation (high alert drugs). Several patient incidents are described and recommendations to reduce risk of occurrence are provided. Contributing factors to the incidents include the following: - failure among healthcare practitioners to recognize the danger of infusing plain sterile water intravenously to treat hypernatremia, - bags of sterile water for injection and inhalation are being mistaken for intravenous (IV) solutions when they are stocked on patient care units, - hospital materials management departments may inappropriately provide patient care areas with liter bags of sterile water, - emergency malignant hyperthermia boxes found in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit can be another source of sterile water bags. These boxes often are stocked with 1 L bags of sterile water to dilute dantrolene sodium for injection, used to treat malignant hyperthermia. Unused or partially used bags of the solution may find their way into IV stock or be hung as an IV solution during emergent treatment. - Respiratory therapy staff may also store or bring bags of sterile water to patient care units for humidification devices used with ventilators or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices. - sterile water for inhalation is available in 250 mL, 500 mL, 1 L, 2 L, and 3 L bags that can be used for wet setups. Some of these bags not only look similar to other IV solutions, but they can also be attached to IV tubing (and may be listed for purchase as ÅgIV solutionsÅh)."

0,A float nurse was to administer BCG 0.05 ml to each of two infants. The BCG was reconstituted and 0.5 ml was withdrawn into an insulin syringe and administered. The error was recognized before vaccination of the second infant. No ill effects were noticed. The dose of BCG is in milliliters and the insulin syringe is calibrated in units therefore introducing an opportunity for error. The dose of BCG is small and can be confused with the more commonly administered Vitamin K1. Two nurses are usually present during the administration of BCG. There was no patient name on the Physician Order Sheet.
1,"An admission medication order for a patient still in the Emergency Department was intended to be Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg BID. A ward clerk transcribed the order as ""HCTZ 200 mg, BID"" which led to the patient receiving Hydrochlorothiazide 200 mg for 16 hours (total of eight tablets). The orders were not verified for 16 hours and there is no consistent way to flag unprocessed and/or unverified orders in the ED. Faxed order sheet was not received by Pharmacy (although there was a check mark indicating that it had been faxed but there was no time indicated); therefore the patient's drug profile was not in Pyxis when the nurse went to get the medication. Multiple medications are available through override function on Pyxis, 24 hours a day, therefore no one called Pharmacy to enquire about the profile. The patient deteriorated and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit."
0,"A medical patient was re-admitted for IV antibiotic treatment when blood cultures were reported as positive one day after discharge. Initial orders for low dose Gentamicin to be administered every eight hours were modified to high dose Gentamicin at the same frequency. Two doses were prepared and administered within eight hours. There is no pharmacist in house after 1800 hours, so orders that are written after that point were not checked and filled until the next morning. The discrepancy in dosing frequency was noted by a clinical pharmacist the next morning and the order was modified. The patient became oliguric and required Intensive Care Unit support for an extended time. The High-Dose Gentamicin Protocol is the order sheet, and a second order is not required on the Doctor's Order Sheet. The protocol sheet does not clearly indicate that the serum creatinine used should be a same day draw or that it is to be administered q24h."

Approximately ten minutes later, the nurse found the patient diaphoretic and unresponsive. A Code ""25"" was called and Narcan was administered with good response. The event occurred at night when staffing was minimal and the nurse was caring for 15 other patient's at the time. Fentanyl is not routinely used in this clinical area, the ordered dose was outside of the normal range and an error was made while programming the PCA pump. Low lighting in the room, misreading the Fentanyl vial, and programming limitations on the PCA pump, compounded calculation errors."

The patient suddenly flopped back down to a supine position, began twitching, and was unresponsive to commands. Respirations ceased and the patient was intubated for airway protection. En route to ICU, the patient rapidly became alert and responsive, moving all limbs. A urine screen confirmed the presence of a muscle relaxant metabolite. The patient was discharged home the next day. Design and usage of Anesthesia cart can create a cluttered workspace thus increasing the risk of error."
0,A patient was scheduled for minor surgery requiring local anesthesia with sedation. Atracurium 15 mg was inadvertently administered instead of Midazolam 1.5 mg resulting in the need for intubation and ventilatory support for approximately 10 min. The patient subsequently recovered. The medication vials were beside each other on the anesthetic drug cart in the Operating Room theatre (same size and colour of glass vial). A shortage of Rocuronium led to the temporary stocking of Atracurium as a substitute.
0,A patient scheduled for elective surgery under local sedation/anesthesia was inadvertently administered Atracurium instead of Midazolam. The patient experienced respiratory distress at the time and chest pain with shortness of breath post operatively. The patient was admitted overnight for monitoring and discharged the next day.

A Canadian fatal case of inappropriate use of the fentanyl patch is described. Actions to reduce the risk of errors in prescribing, dispensing and administration of fentanyl patches are provided. An adult patient presented to an emergency department for management of severe back and leg pain. The patient had been receiving acetaminophen with codeine on an as-needed basis (to a maximum of 480 mg codeine per day) and had received a prescription for oral hydromorphone 2-4 mg every four hours as needed the day before from the family physician. In the emergency department, the patient was treated with intravenous ketorolac with effect, and a fentanyl patch was applied. The patient was also instructed to continue taking the previously prescribed pain medications as needed. Three days later, the patient was experiencing severe pain and returned to the family physician, who increased the fentanyl patch dose from 75 mcg/hour to 125 mcg/hour. The patient was advised to continue taking the oral hydromorphone as needed for pain. The patient reported improvement of pain on a return visit to the family physician to next day. That evening, the patient appeared confused. The following morning, the patient was found unresponsive.

Factors contributing to the numerous patient safety incidents described include multiple fentanyl transdermal patches inadvertently placed; concomitant use of transdermal patches with patient-controlled analgesia; inappropriate prescribing, particularly with the opioid-na?ve population; potential patient abuse of the patch; and lack of patient education, especially regarding administration and storage and disposal. Multiple patch application may be due to poor patch visibility, as many of the patches are clear or translucent, and the fact that there is not a good mechanism in place to remind practitioners, patients, and caregivers to remove old patches. Lack of knowledge of equianalgesic doses contributes to inappropriate prescribing."

1,"As a vasoconstrictor, epinephrine is 100 to 1,000 times more potent than ephedrine. Mix-ups between these two drugs have resulted in serious patient harm. The bulletin highlights a report received by ISMP Canada involving a critical incident with a mix-up between ephedrine and epinephrine as well as references several other major errors with these medications. The drug names look alike and this problem is compounded by the fact that both names start with the letter ""e"" and the drugs are therefore likely to be stored in close proximity in medication storage areas. The products may also be similarly packaged in 1 ml ampoules. A Canadian hospital reported that a patient in labour inadvertently received 1.3mg intravenous (IV) of epinephrine instead of 5 mg IV of ephedrine. The nurse had taken a telephone order for the ephedrine when the patient's blood pressure remained low after initiation of an epidural anesthesia. The nurse was in the process of inadvertently infusing 5 mg of epinephrine but the injection was stopped due to the patient's sudden severe hypertension, tachycardia and nausea. Both the mother and infant were discharged home several days later. Cardiology follow up indicated that the mother had probably experienced a subendocardial myocardial infarction."
0,"This Patient Safety Initiative alert discusses the risk of hypoglycemia when insulin is inadvertently added to an IV or when oral-hypoglycemics are given to non-diabetics. The alert, therefore discusses a wrong drug error with a high alert drug. A case is described where a premature baby received a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) bag that contained insulin instead of heparin. A blood glucose level of 17 mg/dL was reported for a premature baby in the NICU, six hours after a TPN infusion had been started. Despite multiple bolus doses of glucose and an infusion of dextrose 20% in sodium chloride 0.45% (1/2 NS), the hypoglycemia did not completely resolve until the TPN was discontinued. The concerned neonatologist requested that the remaining TPN be sent for analysis, which revealed that the fluid contained insulin instead of heparin. The long-term impact on the neonate has yet to be determined. This hospital receives TPN from a contracted national vendor and an investigation into the event is underway. Similar events reported by ISMP identified the following contributing factors: - similar packaging of insulin and heparin in 10 mL vials - placement of insulin and heparin vials, both typically used each shift/day, next to each other on a counter, drug cart, or under a pharmacy IV admixture hood - mental slips leading to confusion between heparin and insulin, especially since both drugs are dosed in units."

The patient was found unresponsive three days later and subsequently died in hospital of severe anoxic encephalopathy secondary to profound hypoglycemia The case graphically demonstrates what can happen when erroneous information is put on a hospital transfer summary and when the receiving facility fails to question such information. The alert includes a reference to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations 2004 addition of Medication Reconciliation to its list of National Patient Safety Goals."
0,"This lesson describes a patient safety incident where a paediatric patient was given an overdose of a drug to treat a hormonal disorder which resulted in hyponatremia and admission to the ICU. A paediatric patient was ordered 0.2 micrograms of a drug to treat a hormonal disorder. Over the next few days the medication was dispensed by a number of different nurses. It became evident that some nurses had administered 0.2 micrograms while others administered 2 micrograms, ten times the required dosage. Blood tests showed that the patient had developed hyponatremia (low sodium levels) as a result of the overdose and the patient required admission to ICU for monitoring until their condition stabilized. Contributing factors included the following: - According to nursing staff, the numerical dosage on the medication chart was unclear. When the error was identified, medical staff were immediately called to cease the medication order. Unfortunately the dosage was permanently obscured, thus the organisation was unable to ascertain how it had originally appeared. - Double checking of the medication failed on a number of occasions. - Another patient previously on the ward had been ordered 5 micrograms of the same drug thus the dosage of 2 micrograms did not appear excessive. - Pharmacy staff did not check the medication order as per normal weekday protocols. - An earlier blood test had shown mild hyponatremia but medical staff had not checked the result, and no alert was issued by pathology. Actions taken by the facility to reduce likelihood of this incident recurring are provided."
0,"This lesson describes a patient safety incident where mix up of two infusion lines and pumps caused an overdose of analgesia. Postoperatively a patient had a hydration infusion and an analgesic infusion both running through similar pumps. After review by the pain management team the analgesic was ceased by verbal order but no notation made on the drug chart. The nurse caring for the patient briefly removed both infusions from the pump chambers to change the patient's gown. The analgesia line was then reconnected via the hydration pump and vice versa, which caused a rapid overdose of analgesia. The patient was found unconscious and required resuscitation and transfer to ICU. Contributing factors to the incident were the following: ? Failure to document the cessation of the analgesia resulted the infusion continuing unnecessarily. ? The infusion lines were not clearly distinguishable from each other. ? The analgesic line was not removed at the time of the order being verbally ceased. ? Staff did not adhere to the ÅgFive RightsÅh protocol when reconnecting the lines hence it was not immediately identify ed that the lines had been replaced in the incorrect pump chambers Actions taken by the facility to reduce likelihood of recurrence are presented."
1,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses the many potential and real patient safety incidents which occur with heparin (a high alert drug) therapy.

1,"This Patient Safety Advisory discusses several patient safety incidents resulting from accidental administration of high concentration epinephrine, a high alert drug. Contributing factors include 1) expressing the concentration of epinephrine as a ratio strength rather than a metric per volume concentration (wrong dose), and 2) confusion between epinephrine and ephedrine (wrong drug). Drugs which have concentrations expressed as a ratio or percentage are error-prone because: a) practitioners, even physicians and emergency medicine residents, may not recognize or understand the difference between dose concentrations, such as 1:1,000 or 1 mg/ mL and 1:10,000 or 0.1 mg/mL), and b) it is easy to confuse numbers in the thousands because there are so many zeros (i.e., 1,000 looks like 10,000).

1,"This Safety Bulletin discusses two medication safety incidents where chloral hydrate oral solution was given instead of potassium chloride oral solution. One incident occurred in a pediatric patient while the other occurred in a nursing home resident, thus illustrating the deficiencies in the medication system across the continuum of care. The nursing home patient safety incident is described in detail. An 80-year-old resident of a nursing home died after receiving seven doses of chloral hydrate oral liquid (a total of 27 grams) instead of the KCl oral liquid that had been prescribed. The nursing home resident had been receiving KCl 200 mEq daily, divided into four doses, on a long-term basis. To provide a prescription refill, the community pharmacy ordered three 500-mL bottles of KCl liquid (20 mEq/15 mL) from the warehouse. The warehouse mistakenly shipped one bottle of chloral hydrate (500 mg/5 mL) along with two bottles of KCl. The error was not detected when the product was received at the pharmacy or during the dispensing process. The three bottles were labelled by the pharmacy as containing potassium chloride oral liquid and then delivered to the nursing home. The nurses did not detect that the chloral hydrate product was labelled as containing potassium chloride oral liquid, and seven doses of the medication were administered to the resident. Over a period of two days, the resident became lethargic, very sleepy, and apneic and died. The day after the residentÅfs death, during the community pharmacistÅfs regular visit to the nursing home, it was discovered that chloral hydrate had been dispensed instead of KCl."
0,"This Clinical Alert communicates the danger of potassium chloride IV administration through a patient safety incident review where miscommunication of critical laboratory values resulted in potassium chloride toxicity and patient death. Contributing factors to the incident are provided. A middle-aged patient was admitted to a hospital for persistent nausea and diarrhea. Because of dehydration, the patient was administered intravenous fluid with potassium at a rate of 150 cc/hr. On admission, the physician ordered a serum potassium and it was 3.5 mEq/L. Fluids (with the potassium) were continued for the next 48 hours because of persistence of nausea. On the second day after admission, the serum potassium rose to 4.8 mEq/L. On the third hospital day, the patient appeared much improved; however, a serum potassium drawn by the laboratory early in the morning was reported to the floor via phone from the laboratory as 7.1mEq/L (normal = 3.5 - 6.5 mEq/L). The specimen was felt to be ""contaminated"" by the laboratory. A repeat STAT test was ordered. A repeat specimen was drawn the next morning. Shortly after, the physician discontinued the IV fluid that contained potassium. The nursing unit was notified that the potassium was 8.3 mEq/L; the physician was not notified. More than 3 hours after the first blood result was known, the patient lost consciousness and coded. The attending physician arrived during the resuscitation effort. The patient was pronounced dead about 5 hours after the code occurred."

Information is also provided on the prevalence and severity of medication errors in the hospitalized paediatric population; factors that possibly contributed to the labeling and dosing error; and, recommendations intended to reduce the risk of recurrence. A 1 month-old infant with a congenital heart defect was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in the middle of the night. Flecainide suspension 4 mg po TID was prescribed and a pharmacist was called back to the hospital to prepare a supply as the medications from home were not available. The suspension was prepared correctly, with a final flecainide concentration of 5 mg/mL and the correct volume per dose would have been 0.8 mL. The pharmacist mistyped the concentration as ""5 MG/5ML"", and then also typed the dose incorrectly as ""4MG(4ML)"".

0,"This lesson describes a patient safety incident where a patient received two separate doses of a drug they were allergic to. Contributing factors and recommendations for improvement are provided. A patient was admitted for surgery with documented allergies to several medicines. During surgery the patient experienced a hypotensive episode and airway problems while being given intravenous (IV) medication (not previously noted as being allergic to). It was not certain that this medicine was the only contributing factor to this episode. The patient responded well to treatment and the potential allergy alert to this medicine was noted on their medication chart. Several days later, another physician prescribed the same medication for the patient using a different patient record/chart. The order was confirmed between the nurse responsible for the patient and an intern from the operating theatre. There was no discussion of the allergy status. On being given the IV medication the patient experienced sudden collapse and required resuscitation. They were transferred to the intensive care unit for stabilization and observation over 24 hours and recovered well. Contributing factors to the incident were: - No recording of allergy alert on IV medication chart ? no space for allergy alert on this chart. - The main medication chart was not referred to in this process, which would have alerted the staff to the allergy. - Separate charting of medicines, more than one place to document and order medication. - Communication of medication over the phone without the allergy background information being included in this discussion. - The patient was not wearing an allergy bracelet (a red hospital ID band), which alerts staff to patient allergy status."

Other contributing factors of the incident and recommendations to prevent its recurrence are provided. A 63 year old patient was admitted to hospital for elective mitral valve replacement surgery and was administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) according to surgical protocol. Full dose UFH was administered post-operatively until a therapeutic INR was attained with oral warfarin. Several days later the platelet count decreased and an assay to detect for the presence of the antibody responsible for heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia (HIT) was ordered. The positive results for HIT were posted in the laboratory section of the electronic health record and a paper copy sent to the ward. However, the patient had been discharged earlier that day and the chart was sent to health records for filing. About 1 week later, the patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of the same hospital with shortness of breath. The differential diagnosis included pleural effusion and pulmonary embolus. The patient's INR was sub-therapeutic despite a warfarin regimen and so UFH was started IV. The physician in the ED was unaware of the HIT antibody assay; the patient and his family were also not aware of the assay and its implications for future treatment with UFH. Immediately after receiving a bolus dose of UFH IV the patient suffered cardiorespiratory arrest and a stroke.

Contributing factors noted were resemblance in packaging of both syringes, re-stocking errors, and mandated use of orange color coding for all safety-engineered syringes with 25-gauge needles; both the tuberculin and insulin safety-engineered syringes bear the same color coding on the hub of the syringe. Strategies to reduce risk are provided."
0,"This Safety Bulletin describes a fatal medication patient safety incident where a high concentration form of heparin (10,000 units/mL) was used to keep a central venous line patent instead of heparin lock solution (1,000 units/mL). The bulletin also reviews various aspects of risks related to use of heparin flush solutions instead of heparin lock solutions as well as risks related to availability and use of a high concentration of heparin. A triple-lumen catheter was inserted into a patient requiring central venous access (also known as a central venous line [CVL]. After insertion, 1 mL of heparin 10,000 units/mL (instead of the intended 1,000 units/mL) was diluted with 9 mL normal saline and administered into each of the three lumens (total of 30,000 units of heparin). The next day the central line catheter had been accidentally pulled out and had to be replaced. Again, three 1 mL vials of concentrated heparin (10,000 units/mL) were used (each diluted with 9 mL normal saline). The following day, there was a decrease in the patientÅfs blood pressure and severe bruising at the insertion site; lab results showed an elevated aPTT and INR, and a substantial decrease in hemoglobin. Treatment included administration of intravenous fluids, plasma volume expander Pentaspan?, fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, and platelets. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, but later developed septicemia from an infected hematoma and died of complications a few weeks later."

0,"This lesson describes an overdose of insulin to a patient in a hospital which resulted in a prolonged hospital stay but no lasting physical harm. This lesson outlines the contributing factors and the actions the facility took to reduce risk of reoccurrence of this incident; only those actions that are universally applicable are summarized here. A 69 year old female diabetic patient had been admitted to hospital for stabilization of a cardiac condition. On the third day of her admission she was administered 90 units of insulin. The intended order was 9 units but the order was written as ""9U""; i.e. the abbreviation of ""U"" was used instead of writing out ""units"" in full. Shortly after the patient received the insulin, she required urgent medical treatment on the ward and was then taken to the hospital's ICU for further treatment and stabilization. The patient safety incident resulted in traumatization of the patient and a longer length of stay. Contributing factors to the incident were deviation from the hospital policy and procedure for writing medication orders, lack of ready access to the policy and procedure manual for writing orders, deviation from the procedure for administration of insulin which required a double check, distractions in the medication preparation area, and availability of 100 unit syringes."

0,"This bulletin reviews the inadvertent addition of potassium chloride for injection instead of sodium chloride for injection to a renal dialysis fluid for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy and provides actions to reduce risk. Two deaths are attributed to resulting patient safety incidents. The incident occurred in a Canadian hospital where a pharmacy technician, in the process of setting up a batch preparation of dialysis solution, selected concentrated potassium chloride 2 mmol/mL in 250 mL bottles, instead of 23.4 % sodium chloride (NaCl) for Injection in 250 mL bottles. The selected items for dialysis preparation were checked against the manufacturing or ingredient worksheet by a second pharmacy technician. The second technician did not identify the wrong drug. During the manufacturing process, 85 mL of potassium chloride 2 mmol/mL were added to the 3-litre bags of dialysis solution. A third technician later checked the completed batch of dialysis solutions. Again, the incorrect ingredient went unnoticed. When one of the renal dialysis patients died suddenly, the physician identified a serum potassium of almost 8 mmol/L. An immediate laboratory test carried out on the dialysis solution revealed the error. The hospital then recalled the remaining bags of dialysis solution. Officials reviewed the charts of all other patients who had received continuous dialysis since the batch had been produced. It was determined that a second patient was probably exposed to this same batch and had died as a result of hyperkalemia."

0,"This Lesson discusses the appropriate use of morphine as an analgesic in the management of severe chronic pain. A patient safety incident is described where a terminally ill male's chronic and severe pain was ineffectively managed by injectable morphine. The patient also suffered distressing symptoms of some pain, dyspnoea, gurgley respirations due to retained secretions, and restlessness. The patient was prescribed low dose subcutaneous morphine every four hours as necessary. The man became more restless and appeared to be anxious and disorientated. Over the next 24 h the morphine dose and frequency was increased three times with no abating of symptoms. He then received frequent doses of SC morphine, some only five minutes apart. The patient received more than 800 milligrams of Morphine over 10 hours, with little apparent effect on his symptoms and with no requested medical review. The patient's tolerance to morphine was not recognized; nor was the use of adjuncts to better manage the pain and other symptoms presented."

His weight was 104kg; his height 166cm, a BMI of 38 (the typical weight for a child of this age and height would be about 50kg). He received IV morphine, then paracetamol and codeine as required for analgesia. He was then transferred to a small hospital for 4 weeks strict bed-rest. In the course of 14 days, he had been given 32 grams of paracetamol resulting in paracetamol toxicity. He died 18 days after his operation."
0,"Methadone, a synthetic opioid, is likely the least understood narcotic due in part to its infrequent use outside of specialized clinic settings. Methadone has been used in the management of opioid addiction and it is being used more frequently in the management of chronic pain. The Bulletin highlights two of several reports to ISMP Canada regarding methadone errors. The first patient was newly hospitalized and received approximately nine times his usual dose related to a telephone order and change in stock solution concentration. The second patient was receiving methadone daily from a community pharmacy and received a significant under-dose related to a prescribed dose by volume (mL) instead of mg. Additional contributing factors related to both errors and general recommendations for reducing the risk of recurrence are also provided."

0,This Safety Bulletin discusses initiatives and suggests actions to reduce risk to prevent medication patient safety incidents with the use of concentrated potassium chloride as well as errors involving potassium chloride oral liquid.
0,"This Medication Alert reviews serious and fatal patient safety incidents involving the use of concentrated potassium chloride. Several incidents are described. Generally the following have been found to be contributing factors and/or causes for the incidents: ? Wrong ampoule - Potassium chloride ampoules are mistaken for ampoules of similar appearance, such as sodium chloride 0.9% (normal saline) when reconstituting a drug for injection. ? Cognitive mix-up - The intent is to select frusemide / furosemide (a diuretic), but a potassium chloride ampoule is selected by mistake and administered. This type of cognitive error is thought to arise due to the frequent use of potassium chloride in patients who are taking frusemide; conditioning staff to the familiar pairing of the two drugs. ? Preparation error - An intravenous infusion of potassium chloride is prepared incorrectly. The Alert states that all the incidents have a common root cause?potassium chloride ampoules are available as medication stock in wards and other patient care areas. Several general and facility specific recommendations to reduce likelihood of occurrence of this incident are provided. Only those recommendations with universal application are provided in this summary."

0,"The Bulletin describes two medication incidents where incorrect infusion rates for epidural administration resulted in overdoses and patient harm. The first patient was post-operative and receiving fentanyl 2 mcg/mL with bupivacaine 0.125% by epidural infusion for pain management. A student nurse 'piggybacked' a 50 mL minibag containing ketorolac 30 mg to the main line which did not have an infusion pump. She then mistakenly adjusted the flow rate of the epidural infusion pump. The patient experienced a respiratory arrest but was fortunately successfully resuscitated. The second patient was receiving an epidural infusion with hydromorphone 0.01 mg/mL and bupivacaine 0.125% at a rate of 10 mL/hr. At the same time, Lactated Ringers was being administered by peripheral intravenous line using an identical volumetric pump. The patient was transferred from PACU to the obstetrical unit where an RN mistakenly set the infusion pump for the epidural to 100 mL/hour. The patient experienced significant neurological and respiratory symptoms but supportive treatment resulted in a complete recovery. A summary of the contributing factors and recommended actions to reduce the risk of recurrence are provided."
0,"The Bulletin describes a potentially life-threatening near-miss medication incident where a neuromuscular blocking agent was almost inadvertently administered to a patient without ventilator support. An order for intravenous ""acyclovir 1 g IV q8h"" was written in an emergency department (ED) where medications are supplied as wardstock. Since the medication was not a regularly stocked item, the nurse called pharmacy requesting a dose. The pharmacy technician mistakenly sent two 10 mL vials of vecuronium bromide to the ED. The nurse was not familiar with either medication and thought ""vecuronium"" must be a trade name for acyclovir and attempted to look up information in a variety of sources but was unsuccessful. The wrong medication was prepared for administration but at the last moment the nurse contacted pharmacy to clarify and was told to not administer. Other reported errors with neuromuscular blockers describe similar substitution errors. Possible contributing factors to the error described and recommendations for reducing the risk of recurrence are provided. Pictures of Abbott vecuronium product and Organon vecuronium product are included."
0,"This Safety Bulletin describes a patient safety incident where the wrong dose of epinephrine was administered. Causes of this, and other similar errors, including confusion of the strength, expressed as a dilution (1:1000) versus number of milligrams, unfamiliarity with the drug, lack of dosing information with the product are discussed. The incident occurred in a Canadian hospital where epinephrine was administered IV for the treatment of a hypersensitivity reaction. One mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) product was diluted with sodium chloride for injection and then administered, IV push over 2 minutes, by a physician. As a result of receiving 1 mg epinephrine IV, the adult patient experienced adverse effects requiring transfer from a nursing unit to an intensive care unit. The patient was later transferred back to the nursing unit with no long-term effects."

0,"The Bulletin describes a near-miss medication incident where a prescription for oral codeine for a 7 year-old boy was difficult to interpret and the label applied to the bottle, as well as the volume supplied of codeine oral syrup, were not correct. The mother noticed that the directions on the two 250 mL bottles of codeine syrup were labeled ""give 1 tablespoon every 4 hours if needed"". From the information provided on the label, she was able to calculate that a tablespoon would equate to a 75 mg dose, significantly more than the prescribed 15 mg dose. Fortunately, she returned to the store and asked the pharmacist to double-check the prescription. The errors were corrected. A description of the contributing factors as well as recommendations for reducing the risk of recurrence are provided."
0,"Several reports of serious errors involving narcotic medications have been received by ISMP Canada. Two incidents are described and a summary of suggestions arising from a roundtable discussion are included. In the first case, an adult patient admitted for a minor procedure was experiencing significant pain. The physician gave a verbal order for Demerol 25 mg Intravenous (IV) however 25 mg of morphine IV was administered. Naloxone was required to reverse the effects. Miscommunication, a heightened sense of urgency of the situation, and intentions to alleviate suffering quickly, led to the error. b. A post-operative patient was prescribed oxycodone controlled-release (Oxycontin) 20 mg po q8h. The order was misinterpreted as q3h and the patient received several doses every three hours before the error was noted. The patient required naloxone."

0,"This alert addresses the need for increased vigilance in the use of anticoagulants, especially warfarin, as an increased occurrence of complications related to their use has been documented. The alert uses a fatal patient safety incident to illustrate a variety of contributing factors that involve prescribing, dispensing, administration and monitoring errors with the use of warfarin. The case is that of a 78 female admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of embolic CVA and new onset atrial fibrillation for which she was prescribed heparin IV followed by Coumadin(R). She was transferred to a long term care facility where she remained in atrial fibrillation on admission. Coumadin(R) 5 mg daily was continued and increased to 7.5 mg daily after an INR of 1.44. A repeat INR in two weeks was ordered but was not performed. No standing orders for frequency of lab testing for residents on warfarin existed. On day 39 of the resident's stay, the consultant pharmacist noted that no INR had been done and left a note for the physician ""to consider monthly INRs while the resident is receiving Coumadin"". The message was not promptly conveyed to the physician. Several days later the resident developed what looked like symptoms of a urinary tract infection and was prescribed Bactrim(R) (cotrimoxazole) followed by Cipro(R) (ciprofloxacin) when the former did not resolve symptoms. Throughout this treatment, the resident continued to receive warfarin. During days 48 - 50, the resident experienced progressive weakness, dizziness, bruising, and increased lethargy. This was followed by hypotension, tachycardia, obtundedness, and diffuse bruising over her entire body. The patient suffered a large subdural hematoma and expired."

0,"This article discusses patient safety incidents and development of national Danish guidelines related to patients who have experienced excessive blood loss while undergoing invasive procedures and being treated with anticoagulant therapy (high alert drug). A case is described where following a revision of a hip prosthesis a catheter was placed in the dead space around the spinal cord of a patient. The patient received treatment with low molecular heparin (Klexane(R)) to prevent embolus. In the recovery department this treatment was increased to therapeutic dosage (80 mg x 2). The catheter from the spinal cord anaesthesia was removed after 6 days because of bleeding from the incision point. Shortly after, a scan of the spinal cord showed an accumulation of blood around the spinal cord. The patient was treated with blood thinning medicine with oral warfarin (Marevan(R). INR was within therapeutic levels, and then progressed to values over the therapeutic level. Drainage of the pleura for excess blood was performed without review of INR levels. During that procedure, a liver scratch resulted in more bleeding. The patient required abdominal surgery to remove large quantities of blood."
